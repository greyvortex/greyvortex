### 🌌 Who Am I?

I go by **Grey_0x1**—a tag that reflects my ethos:  
- 🧠 _Greyhat_ — free from evil, free from law. Guided by curiosity and consequence.  
- 🔥 _0x1_ — Hex of One. Sun-ruled, victory-coded. A spark, not a shadow.

### 🛠️ What I Do

I’m not here to work under anyone—I’m here to build.  
Whether it's apps, AI systems, or experimental devices, I’m sculpting my own domain and launching my own legacy.

I traverse:
- 🧮 **Computer Science, Math & Physics**
- 🛡️ **Cybersecurity & Low-Level Systems**
- 🤖 **Electronics, Robotics, Rockets & Space**
- 🚗 **Automobile Engineering & Simulations**
- 🌐 **Web Development** (solo dev life demands frontend, too!)

### 🌱 Always Evolving
